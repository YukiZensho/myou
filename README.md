# myou
my implementation of DWM that is barless and has my config file

it has my own config file that is of little use for anyone else trying to use this program, but as it contains config.def.h changing it to the default should be as easy as `mv config.def.h config.h` or to whatever dwm config you might have, dw, it might just tell you that the variables for the bar are unused, that can be ignored.
